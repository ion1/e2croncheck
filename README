e2croncheck â€“ run e2fsck on a snapshot of an LVM volume

USAGE: e2croncheck vgname/lvname
Call this with >/dev/null from your weekly crontab.

The script prints nothing to stderr and returns zero if the check is
successful. Otherwise, the fsck log is printed to stderr and a non-zero value
is returned. The cron daemon will then mail the output to you.

This version of e2croncheck has been modified quite a bit by Johan Kiviniemi.
